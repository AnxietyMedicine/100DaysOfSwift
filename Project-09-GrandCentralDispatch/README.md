# Project 9 - Grand Central Dispatch

This project includes solutions to the challenges.

## Challenges

1. Modify [project 1](../01-Project-1-StormViewer) so that loading the list of NSSL images from our bundle happens in the background. Make sure you call `reloadData()` on the table view once loading has finished!
2. Modify [project 8](../10-Project-8-SwiftyWords) so that loading and parsing a level takes place in the background. Once you’re done, make sure you update the UI on the main thread!
3. Modify project 9 (this one) so that your filtering code takes place in the background. This filtering code was added in one of the challenges for the project, so hopefully you didn’t skip it!

## Screenshots

*No screenshots provided (since the app is visually the same as [project 7](09-Project-7-WhitehousePetitions)).*
